# [POC] Ninja patch for Gothic 2

**DISCLAIMER:** This project is **just a proof of concept!** - I wrote this simple patch to explore the current state of the modding-facilities of gothic 2 - I'm really not interested in adding something else to this, as the engine is terribly old and not really (reliably) working on modern systems without additional work.
