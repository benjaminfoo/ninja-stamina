# Ninja patch for Gothic 2

**DISCLAIMER:** This project is **just a proof of concept!** - I wrote this simple patch to explore the current state of the modding-facilities of gothic 2 - I'm really not interested in adding something else to this, as the engine is terribly old and not really (reliably) useable on modern systems without additional work.

# Usage
* Press the 'V'-Key to enable sprinting, release the key to stop - simple as it.
* In order to change the sprint-key, you just have to change it in the file => 
``ninja-stamina/NINJA/CONTENT/NINJA_STAMINA/_INTERN/NINJA_STAMINA_REGENERATION.D``
